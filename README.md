# Predicting Bioactivity for Acetylcholinesterase Inhibition in Drug Discovery

[**Open Colab Notebook with ML Code**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fIN5KerFnMhgGgvmY1zlXOCUbM2dvy1N?usp=sharing)

## 1. Introduction
Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process. Computational approaches like bioactivity prediction significantly accelerate early-stage drug development. This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a compound inhibiting the **Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)** enzyme — a critical target in neurodegenerative diseases like **Alzheimer’s**.

## 2. What is Bioactivity Prediction?
Bioactivity prediction uses machine learning to estimate the likelihood that a small molecule interacts with a specific biological target.

## 3. Reproducing this web app
To recreate this web app on your own computer, do the following:

Download the entire zip file
Open vs code
Pip install libraries

pip install -r requirements.txt

Then use command: streamlit run app.py 
to run the app. 

## 4. Generating the PKL file
The machine learning model used in this web app will firstly have to be generated by successfully running the included Jupyter notebook bioactivity_prediction_app.ipynb. Upon successfully running all code cells, a pickled model called acetylcholinesterase_model.pkl will be generated.

## 5. The database used: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/
